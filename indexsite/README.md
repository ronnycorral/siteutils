# indexsite
Files used to index site for Swish
<ul>
	<li>indexsite - Bash script called by cron. ~/bin
	<li>makesearchme.py - Python script called by indexsite that does the work. ~/bin
	<li>swish.conf - Config file for swish. Edit to make sure DOMAIN is correct. /var/www/swish/DOMAIN
	<li>swish-e - The binary for swish. If I lose this I'm screwed. I really need to find an alternative. I still need to test I don't need anything else besides this binary. /usr/local/bin
<ul>
